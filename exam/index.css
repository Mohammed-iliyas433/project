child div should have the text "Item 1", "Item 2", and "Item 3" respectively. 
The layout should adjust based on the screen width:
When the screen width is 600px or more, the items should be displayed horizontally in a row.
When the screen width is less than 600px, the items should be displayed vertically in a column.*/
