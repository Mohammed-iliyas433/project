                    <h2>Internet Of Things</h2>
                    <p>The Internet of things (IoT) describes devices with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks. The Internet of things encompasses electronics, communication, and computer science engineering. "Internet of things" has been considered a misnomer because devices do not need to be connected to the public internet; they only need to be connected to a network and be individually addressable.</p>

                    <h3>Importance of IOT</h3>
                   
                    <ul type="square">
                        <li>IoT enables organizations to track assets, optimize systems and reduce waste through advanced data collection and analytics. Smart sensors can monitor production lines for failures, ensure machines receive preventative maintenance when needed, or adjust heating and lighting usage in offices based on occupancy. This leads to less downtime, higher employee productivity and significant cost savings.</li>
                        <li>The data gathered by connected IoT devices provides insights that simply were not possible before. Real-time tracking of products, equipment and interactions allows businesses to analyzing performance, spot trends and make continuous improvements.For example, health IoT devices can monitor patient vitals 24/7, allowing doctors to provide personalized care while avoiding the need for hospital visits. And smart meters enable utility companies to tweak pricing based on real-time demand.</li>
                        <li>IoT automation refers to devicesâ€™ ability to take action without human intervention. Smart heating systems power down when rooms are unused; self-driving trucks deliver goods without a driver; and Alexa decides to order milk when your fridge runs low.This automation allows businesses to reduce labor costs while accelerating decision velocity for optimized operations. As AI and machine learning mature, organizations will continue expanding their use of IoT automation.</li>
                        <li>IoT also has powerful implications for understanding and connecting with customers. Retailers can now track real-world customer journeys through stores to optimize layouts. Utilities can rapidly detect outages through smart grid infrastructure. And product companies can analyze how customers are actually using devices to inform design improvements.Even simple conveniences like remotely monitoring and brewing coffee from your smartphone demonstrate IoTs potential to connect businesses to consumers in new ways.</li>

                    <h3>Applications of IOT</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wearable technology is the hallmark of IoT applications and one of the earliest industries to deploy IoT. We have fit bits, heart rate monitors and smartwatches these days.</li>
                        <li>The smart home is probably the first thing when we talk about the IoT application. The example we see the AI home automation is employed by Mark Zuckerberg. Alan Pan's home automation system, where a string of musical notes uses in-house functions.</li>
                        <li>IoT applications can transform reactive medical-based systems into active wellness-based systems. Resources that are used in current medical research lack important real-world information. It uses controlled environments, leftover data, and volunteers for clinical trials. The Internet of Things improves the device's power, precision and availability. </li>
                        <li>Most of you have heard about the term smart city. Smart city uses technology to provide services. The smart city includes improving transportation and social services, promoting stability and giving voice to their citizens.</li>
                        <li>By the year 2050, the world's growing population is estimated to have reached about 10 billion. To feed such a large population, agriculture needs to marry technology and get the best results. There are many possibilities in this area. One of them is Smart Greenhouse.</li>
                        <li>A connected car is a technology-driven car with Internet access and a WAN network. The technology offers the user some benefits such as in-car infotainment, advanced navigation and fuel efficiency</li>
